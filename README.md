vdstatus
========

A simple replacement for i3status that is both extensible and customizable.
Documentation is pending, but no promises.

Base requirements:
* python 3
* [pyyaml](https://pyyaml.org/)

Some plugins have dependencies of their own:
* [psutil](https://github.com/giampaolo/psutil) - for mem.py and disk.py
* [pytz](https://pythonhosted.org/pytz/) - optional for date.py (for custom time zone)
